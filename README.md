# Runners High

A PERN stack web application for runners who want to track their runs.

### Why Runners High?

Ultimately, I wanted to build something that I could use. As I run every day and have goals to partake in marathons and ultra-marathons, the idea of building an app that would be in service of that goal became an exciting prospect.
